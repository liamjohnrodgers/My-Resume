    <h2>Experience</h2>
    
    <h3>Relationship Manager</h3>
    <p>CDM Media</p>

    <h3>Delegate Sales Executive</h3>

    <h3>General Manager</h3>
    <p>Dirty Liquor</p>
    <p>Nov 2021 - Jan 2022</p>
    <p>After 5 months at AGM level I was promoted to GM.
        I quickly refined what I had already learnt about how to ensure all staff were happy and that we retained
        staff as well as got staff levels to where they needed to be which in the current hospitality environment
        is very important.
        This role also taught me how to perform safety checks and risk assessment creation.
        Staying within budgets is another important skill I gained.
        I improved midweek sales by about 80% by organising a weekly pub quiz.</p>

    <h3>Assistant General Manager</h3>
    <p>Dirty Liquor</p>
    <p>Jun 2021 - Nov 2021</p>
    <p>Being AGM meant learning how to properly train staff to the standards which we expected, as well as
        how to recruit staff which would fit in with the team and business.
        I learnt what it takes to ensure that the business meets the EHO standards.
        Becoming trained in the pizza kitchen was a necessary skill for me to learn in order to provide cover in
        the kitchen from time to time.
    </p>

    <h3>Assistant Manager</h3>
    <p>Albion & East Limited</p>
    <p>Feb 2020 - Jun 2021</p>
    <p>As assistant manager I was taught stock control and was responsible for it.
        Becoming more involved in the back of house taught me how to control a busy food pass during
        bottomless brunches. Learning how to properly staff shifts was a key skill taught to me.
